Do you hate these "motivational" quote images, with butterflies and dramatic skies and believe-in-yourself-you-can-do-its? Me tooâ€¦ That's why I thought to make this little program. The code selects a famous quotation from a list and pairs it with a photo. The process is randomized, which makes it quite crazy in terms of what kind of image might pop up. This also means, it's beyond my control, as it searches Flickr for photos using keywords that **should** be relevant to the quotation content. But this depends entirely on users uploading the correct tag, which means I assume no responsibility, so be warned!
